## Description
1-v-1 Challenge Bet is a game that gives friends the opportunity to bet each other on the outcome of various sporting events.
For the purposes of this project, it is assumed that once the user/game player challenges their friend to a game, that 
friend accepts the invitation and plays the game. In reality, and in future iterations, the recipient of the bet must first accept.
Both users/friends would also be playing for real money whereby payment would be accepted by the platform.
The matches have pre-determined results, which are stored using local Storage in Javascript. Future iterations will contain the use of databases.
Although no money is acceptance on the site for technological and licencing reasons, the idea behind the project is to give users a "first glimpse"
of how a production ready version of the site may look. It is ideal for getting initial feedback from the target audience, by asking users which test
features they like, do not like, would like to add etc. 

## User Stories
External users have the following goals when entering the website;
1. Choose a sporting event which they can challenge their friend to bet on:<br>

## Testing




## Features

## Scalabity
Future iterations of the game will enable challenge bet requests to be sent in real time to other friends. They will
have the choice whether to accept the bet of not. Real money payments can also be added to further releases.

## Technologies



To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.
