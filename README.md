## Description
1-v-1 Challenge Bet is a game that gives friends the opportunity to bet each other on the outcome of various sporting events.
For the purposes of this project, it is assumed that once the user/game player challenges their friend to a game, that 
friend accepts the invitation and plays the game.

## User Stories

## User Experience (UX)

## Testing

## Features

## Scalabity
Future iterations of the game will enable challenge bet requests to be sent in real time to other friends. They will
have the choice whether to accept the bet of not. Real money payments can also be added to further releases.

## Technologies

`python3 -m http.server`


To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.
