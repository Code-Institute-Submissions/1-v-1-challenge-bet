## Description
1-v-1 Challenge Bet is a game that gives friends the opportunity to bet each other on the outcome of various sporting events.
For the purposes of this project, it is assumed that once the user/game player challenges their friend to a game, that 
friend accepts the invitation and plays the game. In reality, and in future iterations, the recipient of the bet must first accept.
Both users/friends would also be playing for real money whereby payment would be accepted by the platform.

## User Stories

## User Experience (UX)
Accodions used due to popularity on other bookies websites (ADD SCREENSHOTS)

## Testing




## Features

## Scalabity
Future iterations of the game will enable challenge bet requests to be sent in real time to other friends. They will
have the choice whether to accept the bet of not. Real money payments can also be added to further releases.

## Technologies



To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.
